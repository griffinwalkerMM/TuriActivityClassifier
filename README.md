## Turi Create Activity Classifier on Skafos

This example is based off of an example provided in the Turi Create docs. https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/userguide/activity_classifier/

This repo's main executable is `activity_classifier.py`.
This script loads the data from a public S3 bucket, performs some quick data cleanup and then exports this data to supporting script. `/common/load_data.py`
